# Evolution & Feasibility

## Evolution

### History of Monitoring in Tech Space

- Monitoring in the tech space has a long history, dating back to the early days of computing. 
- As systems grew in complexity, the need for monitoring and observability increased. 
- Initially, monitoring was a manual process that required human intervention. 
- However, with the development of scripting and automation, monitoring became more efficient and scalable. 
- The evolution of monitoring is illustrated in the timeline below.
